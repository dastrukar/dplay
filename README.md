dPlay is a very simple Doom launcher thing that I made for fun.

## How does dPlay work?
dPlay uses a config file, which you can modify to add launch option/parameters.
If there isn't a config file for dPlay in the directory, dPlay will generate a new config file on its own.

## Why?
Because I was bored, and realised that some of my friends aren't that good at loading Doom mods.

that's it really ;]
